# Start check: Lucien (`lucien`)

Written by `scripts/gamedata/story_check.py` from the records, the winning compiled scripts and the settings loaders in the Ultra profile. Verdicts: **files** a record decides it; **script** a script decides it, read; **run time** a settings loader or script sets it at load; **conflict** two sources disagree; **unread** named. Conditions read as the game reads them: "or" joins OR'd conditions, ";" separates what is all needed.

## The payoff

- **Dragonslayer** (completes at 200): nothing is given on its completing stages.
- **Paarthurnax** (completes at 99, 100): nothing is given on its completing stages.

## Three questions

**Is Skyrim.esm:0242BA MQ105, and is stage 160 the one that completes it?** Yes: Skyrim.esm:0242BA is MQ105 (The Way of the Voice), and stage 160 is its only completing stage.

**Who starts The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, and where?** None:

**Does Dragonborn's cultist node read Timing is Everything's level (25 in its settings.ini), or something else?** Timing is Everything's setting iTIE_MinimumLevel:Dragonborn = 25 (settings.ini in Timing is Everything SE - Settings Loader).

## Run-time values

Settings loaders the story's globals touch, and whether the script the game runs reads their settings.ini:

- TimingIsEverything: script TIE_MCMScript on TimingIsEverything.esp:005E3B; the copy that wins is C:/LoreRim\mods\[LoreRim] - SPID Files and Script Overwrites\scripts\tie_mcmscript.pex (extends SKI_ConfigBase); it carries no settings.ini value into a global, so the globals keep their record values unless the player changes them in the menu.
- Wyrmstooth: script WT_MCMScript on Wyrmstooth.esp:AC1487; the copy that wins is C:/LoreRim\mods\Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader\Scripts\WT_MCMScript.pex (extends MCM_ConfigBase); it reads its MCM Helper settings and sets globals from them.

- Timing is Everything: Dragonborn level setting 25 (settings.ini in Timing is Everything SE - Settings Loader), meant for DLC2CultistAttackMinLevel_KRY (record 25.0 from TimingIsEverything.esp; in game 25.0; **files**).
- Wyrmstooth: WTStartLevel is 10 in a new game (record 20.0 in Requiem - Wyrmstooth.esp). Why: OnConfigInit runs once when the menu registers in a new game; it sets `migrated` and calls LoadSettings, which goes on only while bEnabled:Maintenance is set (it is 1) and then calls Load, which reads iWTGeneralRequirementsMinimalLevel:Requirements (10, settings.ini in Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader) and sets WTStartLevel to it; MigrateToMCMHelper, which would copy the global's record value (20.0) into that setting, runs only from OnGameReload or OnConfigOpen while `migrated` is false, and OnConfigInit has already set it, so a new game never migrates (an older save made before the loader would); OnGameReload reloads the settings only when bLoadSettingsonReload:Maintenance is set; it is 0, so later loads keep whatever the global holds.
