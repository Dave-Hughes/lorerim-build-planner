# Start check: Pieces of the Past (`pieces-of-the-past`)

Written by `scripts/gamedata/story_check.py` from the records, the winning compiled scripts and the settings loaders in the Ultra profile. Verdicts: **files** a record decides it; **script** a script decides it, read; **run time** a settings loader or script sets it at load; **conflict** two sources disagree; **unread** named. Conditions read as the game reads them: "or" joins OR'd conditions, ";" separates what is all needed.

## 1. Pieces of the Past (`DA07`, Skyrim.esm:0240B8, Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim.esp)

- Dialogue with Silus Vesuius, placed in Silus Vesuius' House, "I'll do it, but you better be willing to pay me for my efforts.": SetStage 13 (when: the speaker is Silus Vesuius). Reply: "Here are my notes about them. I'll gladly pay you for getting the pieces any way you can. No questions asked."

## 2. Reforging the Past (`DA07PlayerHasReforged`, SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp:000D9B, SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp)

**Started by**

- Dialogue with Silus Vesuius, placed in Silus Vesuius' House, "There is another way, I can reforge it. (Persuade)": SetStage 5 (when: the speaker is Silus Vesuius; GetActorValue >= SpeechHard (now 75) or HasPerk Daedric Smithing == 1). Source: TIF__madShards.Fragment_0 on INFO SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp:000D72 (SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp). **script**
- Start-game flag: the quest runs from the start of the game. Source: SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp:000D9B DNAM (SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp). **files**
- (First objective shown at stage 5; a call to a later stage advances the quest instead.)

**Second step** (what moves it to its second objective, often the real test)

- Second objective: "(Optional) Return the Razor to Silus.". Source: SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp:000D9B QOBJ 20. **files**
- **unread**: no fragment of its own shows the second objective, so the stage that moves it isn't traced.

**Who and where**

- First objective: "Reforge the Razor at any forge.". Source: SilusJournal_ReforgeRazor.esp:000D9B QOBJ 10. **files**
- Target alias DawnStarForge (forced): a marker (forced reference, placed in Dawnstar). **files**

- The door from Leigelf's House into Dawnstar needs the Key to Leigelf's House, carried by Leigelf. Source: Skyrim.esm:013CF1 (COTN Dawnstar - Requiem Patch.esp). **files**
- Ways in: Dawnstar: 2 doors, 2 locked. A door is a need only when every way in is locked. **files**

**Gives**: nothing on its completing stages.

## Routes into the first quest from outside the starts

### dialogue INFO Skyrim.esm:0B82EE

- In one sentence: Talk to Silus Vesuius (Imperial) in Silus Vesuius' House and choose "Sounds good.", when the speaker is Silus Vesuius: SetStage 10 on DA07 (Pieces of the Past).

## The payoff

- **Dragonslayer** (completes at 200): nothing is given on its completing stages.
- **Paarthurnax** (completes at 99, 100): nothing is given on its completing stages.

## Three questions

**Is Skyrim.esm:0242BA MQ105, and is stage 160 the one that completes it?** Yes: Skyrim.esm:0242BA is MQ105 (The Way of the Voice), and stage 160 is its only completing stage.

**Who starts The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, and where?** None:

**Does Dragonborn's cultist node read Timing is Everything's level (25 in its settings.ini), or something else?** Timing is Everything's setting iTIE_MinimumLevel:Dragonborn = 25 (settings.ini in Timing is Everything SE - Settings Loader).

## Run-time values

Settings loaders the story's globals touch, and whether the script the game runs reads their settings.ini:

- TimingIsEverything: script TIE_MCMScript on TimingIsEverything.esp:005E3B; the copy that wins is C:/LoreRim\mods\[LoreRim] - SPID Files and Script Overwrites\scripts\tie_mcmscript.pex (extends SKI_ConfigBase); it carries no settings.ini value into a global, so the globals keep their record values unless the player changes them in the menu.
- Wyrmstooth: script WT_MCMScript on Wyrmstooth.esp:AC1487; the copy that wins is C:/LoreRim\mods\Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader\Scripts\WT_MCMScript.pex (extends MCM_ConfigBase); it reads its MCM Helper settings and sets globals from them.

- Timing is Everything: Dragonborn level setting 25 (settings.ini in Timing is Everything SE - Settings Loader), meant for DLC2CultistAttackMinLevel_KRY (record 25.0 from TimingIsEverything.esp; in game 25.0; **files**).
- Wyrmstooth: WTStartLevel is 10 in a new game (record 20.0 in Requiem - Wyrmstooth.esp). Why: OnConfigInit runs once when the menu registers in a new game; it sets `migrated` and calls LoadSettings, which goes on only while bEnabled:Maintenance is set (it is 1) and then calls Load, which reads iWTGeneralRequirementsMinimalLevel:Requirements (10, settings.ini in Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader) and sets WTStartLevel to it; MigrateToMCMHelper, which would copy the global's record value (20.0) into that setting, runs only from OnGameReload or OnConfigOpen while `migrated` is false, and OnConfigInit has already set it, so a new game never migrates (an older save made before the loader would); OnGameReload reloads the settings only when bLoadSettingsonReload:Maintenance is set; it is 0, so later loads keep whatever the global holds. Source: WT_MCMScript (C:/LoreRim\mods\Wyrmstooth - Settings Loader\Scripts\WT_MCMScript.pex). **run time**
